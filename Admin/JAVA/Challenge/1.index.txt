       significant event (creation, starting, and termination). Use
       Thread.sleep() to simulate long-running tasks and Thread.getState() to
       print the thread's state.
 c101. Create three threads. Ensure that the second thread starts only after
       the first thread ends and the third thread starts only after the second
       thread ends using the join method. Each thread should print its start
       and end along with its name.
 c102. Simulate a traffic signal using threads. Create three threads
       representing three signals: RED, YELLOW, and GREEN. Each signal
       should be on for a certain time, then switch to the next signal in order.
       Use sleep for timing and synchronize to make sure only one signal is
       active at a time.
 c103. Write a program that creates a single-threaded executor service.
       Define and submit a simple Runnable task that prints numbers
       from 1 to 10. After submission, shut down the executor.
 c104. Create a fixed thread pool with a specified number of threads
       using Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int). Submit multiple tasks
       to this executor, where each task should print the current thread's
       name and sleep for a random time between 1 and 5 seconds.
       Finally, shut down the executor and handle proper termination
       using awaitTermination.
 c105. Write a program that uses an executor service to execute multiple
       Callable tasks. Each task should calculate and return the factorial
       of a number provided to it. Use Future objects to receive the
       results of the calculations. After all tasks are submitted, retrieve
       the results from the futures, print them, and ensure the executor
       service is shut down correctly.
